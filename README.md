# Magento 2 - Product Designer

A product designer tool for Magento 2, this extension allows you to sell personalised products on your Magento store. A new 'Customize' button will appear on products, which then allows the site user to customise on top of the product image. Customers can add Text, Graphics, and Images,  personalising it as they need.  The Customize button can be turned on for all products or only certain attribute sets.
